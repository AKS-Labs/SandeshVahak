Summary: Never miss SMS messages across devices via your own Telegram bot
Description: |
  Never Miss a Message Again! 📱✨

  SandeshVahak (संदेश वाहक - "Message Carrier" in Sanskrit) is your personal SMS bridge that keeps you connected across all your devices! Say goodbye to the frustration of missing important messages on your secondary phone.

  🎯 The Problem We Solve:

  Got a work phone, personal phone, or that old device you use for specific tasks? Tired of constantly checking multiple devices for SMS messages? SandeshVahak has your back! It automatically syncs SMS messages from any device to your main device using the power of Telegram - and the best part? YOU control everything!

  ✨ What Makes SandeshVahak Special:

  • 🔒 100% Private: Uses YOUR Telegram bot - no sneaky third parties, no data mining, no corporate surveillance. Your messages stay yours!
